It has bands from time to time, which is what makes it a 4. Not many places have an area that converts from a stage at night to tables during the day. I would give it a 3 for food. It's just your typical, everyday bar food. Nothing to write home about, but it's not necessarily bad. Just average. I've been here a couple of times, and I have always enjoyed myself. The service is also fantastic, which also helps its rating. I would recommend you stop at least once to try it out, especially if there is a band.\n",

      "I was in town on business and we were exhausted and starving. This place had good reviews so we gave it a go. We were blown away by how good everything was! The house seasoned wings were perfect, but the real star was the Irish Nachos. Reuben filling on top of hot waffle fries with Russian dressing? We still talk about how delicious they were. We're looking forward to visiting again the next time work brings me to Streetsboro.\n",
      "\n",

      "I'm generally not a harsh critic for many things, if there is effort involved I wouldn't be quick to judge on a first visit basis, but waiting almost 45 minutes just to be approached and then asked what we would like to drink is lousy. That's almost saying that you straight up, don't care. How on earth there was a mix up, is beyond me. Even on a Friday/Saturday night with the place packed that wouldn't be okay. Me and my girlfriend got our drinks after 45 minutes and ordered our food. We got boneless wings/fritters and they tasted like dirty fryer oil, as did the breaded chicken sandwiches. The Hummus was really good though. It honestly deserves 1 star, but the fact that we had a lot of that taken off our bill was nice at least.\n",

      "My husband and I have been here twice, the first time being the day they opened and the second time, exactly two weeks later. It looks great inside. You'd never know it was previously an Eat n Park. It's got a large bar and tons of huge televisions. Both times my husband got the Cuban and one time I got the reuben and the other got the Cuban. We also got the fried pickles. Everything has been delicious. Service was very prompt and unlike the other review it seems obvious to us you can sit at the bar or wait to be seated by the hostess since there's a hostess stand. My only gripe is the prices. They're a smidge high in my opinion. \r\n",

      "This place is centrally located which is good and the food is pretty decent. Two things that are not ok is the service and the cleanliness. The waitress was ok but didn't clear the dishes or refill drinks without being asked. As for the cleanliness, the place was a mess. There was a huge mess on the floor below our table where a family of 8 had all of their kids before us and no one thought to sweep under the table or wipe the chairs before sitting a new group. The rest of the restaurant was no better, including the bathrooms. Blah! If that is what we could see, imagine what we couldn't see in the kitchen!\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is pretty good as a step up from dingy bar atmosphere and fried food, but it's nothing out of the ordinary and much like an Applebee's, TGIFridays, or Chili's. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I've been a few times. They always have certain beers on draft for a decent price. The most recent time, we shared the nachos with chili with a few friends and I've gotta say, they were good. Huge pile and great for 4 people to share. I ordered the Moose salad with grilled chicken and balsamic. Again, huge salad so I poured dressing on half and ate half. It came with pita bread like Rocknes salads do, but mine was on the stale side. I will say, I think the croutons were homemade and they were good. \r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "We got to your establishment at 6:30pm 11/18/15. The waitress we had really didn't wait us. Never asked how we were doing. Never asked if we needed anything. Someone else brought out our food. I had gotten the chicken parm sliders. There was like no sauce on it. The chicken was dry. Both plates were hot but food was cold. My bf asked for no tomato. You could tell that someone had put it on and took it off because the juices and seeds was on his burger. Couldn't asked for sauce she didn't come back except when she gave us our bill. She was way friendlier to the other tables around us but not to us. Idk. Couldn't tell you her name. She didn't say. We basically sat in the back corner at a round table. I was there bout a month ago and had great food and service thought I would come back because I wanted my bf to experience it but it sucked. What sucked even more he drives an hr to see and then I actually live an hr away from your restaurant. So waste of my money, time, and gas.\n",

      "Do not get wings on wing night. Its a matter of them getting wings out and not cooking to order. I can ask for them extra crispy any other day but wing night, you get what they give you.\n",

      "This place is a must stop destination if traveling to or through Streetsboro.  Great ribs and the best wings I've had.  So much better that the chains.  It's a family owned sports bar and the pride in ownership shows.   If you decide to drop in and she's on duty ask to be seated in Sam's area.  Sam is knowledgeable regarding the menu and beverage choices and will see to it that you have a great experience.  You can't go wrong here\n",

      "\n",
      "Food was ok but nothing to write home about. Be careful with the add-ons and up-sells. Everything is extra, and it adds up. A side of sweet potato fries was over $7. Celery for the wings is extra. If you need extra chips for your spinach dip, they're extra. Our bill ended up being nearly $60 for two people. We could have gone out to a nice steak house for that much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Always consistent food.  Nothing crazy awesome, but better than many other places.  Portions are large enough.  Picky, but wish they had a hotter wing sauce to choose from.  Their hottest sauce is barely hot in other restaurants.  \r\n",

      "Service can be a little mixed.  Not unlike other places.  Last night we went in and had the best service we have ever had there.  I missed her name, but she was extremely attentive and checked on us multiple times to see if everything was okay.  This was nice to see as they weren't very busy.  Too many times, not being busy turns into bad service.  Not this time.\n",
      "\n",

      "We were so excited when this place opened. We were disappointed the first time we went. Hubby said the bar stools were too low for him to be comfortable and I found myself sliding around on one all over the floor.  But, since then, we've made a few trips back. We sit at a table now since he is in a wheelchair. The staff and patrons always hold doors for us, when we come in and when we leave. The server doesn't even hesitate to move a chair out of the way so I can get the wheelchair under the table..  Drink service is fast.  When I asked what beer the server would recommend, she chose one for me that was perfect and I will order from now on. The dining room is bright and welcoming and the huge televisions on the wall are easy to see. We are becoming Sunday regulars there.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I have frequented this restaurant pretty regularly lately and have been pleased with the food and service in the past.  Tonight we were a little frustrated with the service as there were only 3 other tables and a total of 3 servers.  Our server took our drink order, 10 minutes later my husband was still waiting for his beer as they needed to change the keg and were having issues.... that was fine the problem was the bartender and the server seemed to keep forgetting about it until finally my husband decided to ask for a different beer (server did mention it would be comped because it took so long).  We patiently waited for the server to come take our order, she didn't write it down and while I noticed her talking to another server when going back to enter the order she forgot and asked another server to come and ask what we ordered.  After serving our dinner she never came over to ask if everything was ok or if we needed anything, or of my husband wanted another beer (no up sale at all).  She seemed more interested in talking to her co-workers than working.  I'm not a hard customer to please but when mistakes are made, they are best made and easily forgiven when the restaurant is busy and the servers are working. I've also had grilled chicken salads there before that were awesome but this time the chicken was dry and chewy I had to pick the chicken out and eat what was left.  My husband however was pleased with the ribs he ordered.  We will be back again, but if this continues to be the service we get I'm afraid we'll have to go somewhere else. \r\n",

They only reason i didnt give 5 stars was the service was slow today. Otherwise happy Moose was impressive today. Kudos to the owner and his cooks!\n",
      "\n",
      "Always intrigued by this place.   We went on a Sunday and was not too busy.  First sign that it was not gonna be good was the locking mechanism attached to front door.  The kind that one puts a key in for someone stopping by later.  R they selling?  \r\n",

I had the buffalo chicken dip appetizer and the jumbo pretzel sticks appetizer; both were delicious. They serve Pepsi products (I prefer Coke) but that wasn't enough to dampen my spirits. I'd definitely come back.\n",

I had the angus beef sliders with fries, and my husband had the six pepper dry rub wings which were ridiculously good! Also try their Apple CinniMule - surprisingly pretty darn good! Overall, great place to stop by if you're looking for a well seasoned meal, good drinks and pleasant staff. Should we ever find ourselves in this area again, we'll definitely come back!\n",

The food is OK, but the atmosphere is just sad. They really want to close by 10:00, so don't plan on sticking around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright food bad service. Waited 40 minutes for my waitress to come around so I could get my bill. I could see her. She was busy vaping behind a wall by the kitchen entrance. I finally flagged down a different waitress and got my bill. The whole time my waitress/ bartender was busy huffing flavored water vapor. No one ever checked on me the whole time. I won't be back. I hope you won't go there either. Next time I'll listen to my coworkers and go to Rocknes.\n",

A number of drinks containing 3 Olives cherry and some apple pie moonshine shots and I was toast. The fried pickles were delicious and that's not the booze talking. We had pretty good service too! Of course we will be returning!\n",

      "My visit today just confirmed why we don't frequent this restaurant. Food was decent(not worth a $35 check) but service was horrible. There were maybe 8 tables including people sitting at the bar so obviously not busy. Which was okay until our server brought out our food and never returned. We needed drink refills and extra napkins but couldn't ask our server. I ended up asking another server who was busy cleaning tables and sweeping floors.our server brought the check, came back a minute later to collect but it wasn't ready yet. She never returned. We ended up leaving cash. Normally we like to leave at least 20% for a tip and typically give more, especially when service deserves it. Very disappointing.\n",

      "The service was good and friendly, the food however was not. I orderd a cheeseburger and fries. When it came out the burger was all lumpy and didnt look like a burger at all. The meat didnt taste very good at all. The fries were the best part of the meal. Im very perticular about my burgers and this deffinatly disapointed.\n",

      "My friends and I were cut off after a few beers despite having THREE designated drivers among our 7 person party.  I liked the place but I'll never go back if I can't drink as much as I'd like.  It was so bizarre.  They must have not liked the hundreds of dollars we'd already spent and must not have wanted the hundreds of dollars we'd have likely continued to spend, I guess.\r\n",

      "Kind of an odd duck. More of a resteraunt type feeling but with a very expensive menu. Service was good. Apple pie shot was amazing. Very loud for not having that bar/club type of atmosphere.  So ...id say was just ok.\n",

      "Great food. I have never had a better pulled pork sandwich ever. It was fantastic. The only downside was the noise level due to the industrial decor\n",

      "The boneless wings are really good. We got the moosey platter which is 30 wings (we picked the boneless) and one side. We chose garlic parm, hot garlic, buffalo ranch, medium, and six pepper dry rub. I don't have anything bad to say about any of the flavors. The fries were also really good. For the price, it is definitely worth a try. This was a good meal for my boyfriend and I and for 24.99 we will definitely be back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great food and service! My companions had beer. I was undecided between the Pinot Grigio and the Chardonnay. I asked the waitress if I could have a taste of each to determine which one I preferred. (A common practice in AZ). She stated that they don't do tastings and the alcohol was weighed so they couldn't just give me a little. We asked for the manager who promptly came to our table. She said the same thing but said she, too, would have to get permission from someone else. As it turned out, they did bring me a sample of each and I chose the Pinot Grigio. They were very accommodating although I suspect if we hadn't pushed it they would have just left it at no. Everyone in our party was very pleased with their food selection. Ambiance was nice and they weren't too busy. We definitely would go back.\n",

      "we have gone to this restaurant several times and always enjoyed it. however, we called a hamburger order in-picked it up. four days later we receive an alert from our credit card company questioning us of a large tip applied to the amount. NOPE we didn't leave a tip cause it was a pickup. we looked over our receipt. after 2 phone calls we were told this sometimes happens and we needed to give them our credit card info so they can refund us the amount. i'm sorry but the tip was more than the hamburger and all I get is oh sometimes this happens! well they have now lost us as customers and our family of 6 that we would take there. \"SOMETIMES THIS HAPPENS!\"??????????? what is up with that? Beware it could happen to you!\n",

      "Yesterday stopped on the way back from going to the casino at 10:30pm. They were closing and denied us service. It was a Saturday night at 10:30...? There is no way this place is going to stay in business long if they are not open on weekends past 11pm. Be warned , do not plan on going here late at night. All of there customers must be old people that go to bed before 8.\n",

      "This has been my go-to place for quite a while, but it has been slipping lately.  At the very least I think I should be able to go into a sports bar and get a great draft beer.  This has not been the case recently, with the Yuengling being off colored and bitter tasting.  The Miller Lite has also been bitter.  The cooling system must also be off, because the chilled glasses aren't doing it.\r\n",
      "The salad selection is great, but some variety in the menu would sure be welcome.  The menu never changes and some healthy entrees would seem to be more family and/or couples friendly.  Bar food is not for everyone.\r\n",

      "I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had high chairs as it looked very bar-y when we walked in.  We ordered the fried pickles, which were pretty good.  The wings were just ok and the bill was huge for what we had.  It just felt very overpriced for very average food.  We didn't even finish our wings, and that's saying something.  Our service was mostly attentive, however.  This would probably be a good place to drink and watch a game.\n",

I've had friendly and attentive service both times I stopped in.

Great well run restaurant.\n",

This restaurant is no exception. Food was okay at best. I had chicken wings that were a bit under cooked. They came drenched in sauce. It was literally floating in it.  Salad was decent. \r\n",

      "Used to come here quite often and really enjoyed it but the last few times it has not been good. The quality of food is not good, the zucchini planks were so greasy and the fries used to be really plentiful but instead there were hardly any fries at all. I ordered a side of Cole slaw and paid $1.99 for two spoonfuls. There were bugs on the walls and the temperature was not controlled very well. Very disappointing!\n",

      "My husband and I ate here yesterday and both were told how wonderful the fish sandwich was. So we ordered it. First the fries that came along with sandwich were limp and greasy. It is pretty hard to mess up fries but they did. The fish was a glorified frozen fish stick with breading looks like a very large chicken McNugget. It was served on what looked like a yummy French baguette. It wasn't. It was bland, tasteless and rubbery. We asked for the Catawba sauce (mayo and siracha) which turned out to be the only good tasting thing we ordered. Don't order the fish sandwich no matter what anyone says, unless you like fish McNugget sandwiches.  $42.00 for two fish sandwiches and fries that we did not finish or take home, 1 beer that my husband didn't finish drinking, water for me, fried pickles (tasted good not didn't like the breading).  Overall not good food and not worth the price.  Save your money and go somewhere else.\n",

      "Staff: Service was fast and attentive, but our waiter was weird! He did help me rearrange my order into a combo to save money,  which was great. Was not a fan of him telling us to take our time looking at the menu because he \"really had to pee!\"  TMI buddy. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Food: Huge portions. Fries and chips are made in house.  Fries are the skin on boardwalk style and chops were large cut kettle style. I got boneless wings with loaded chips.

All were above average quality and a great deal for the portion. \r\n",

Fresh cut fries were pretty good too and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. Lots of TVs and the bartender Crystal was very friendly and informative. Happy Hour is 12-7pm Monday thru Friday - just wish we had one of these in Wadsworth. There's really no good wing places like this nearby.\n",

Great place for family dining or a night out without the kiddies.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of the best sports bars around!!! Great food, good beer selection, and reasonable prices. On top of that the servers are super friendly and are exceptional at their jobs!!! Highly recommend!!! (And the fried pickles/dip are the bomb!!!)\n",
      "\n",
      "The place looked VERY busy, but there was no waiting for a table. It's one of those sports bar/restaurant places with \"industrial\" ceilings that make it super loud to begin with. But add a packed house, several televisions and loud music and you can't hear yourself think, let alone talk to your table mates. I expected this and it didn't bother me at first but my 22 year old son (who frequents BW3's which is also loud) said he wouldn't go back because of it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We ordered the spinach dip to start. Unfortunately--perhaps because it was so loud--the waitress heard chicken tenders. A man came over with the chicken later and we had to send him away TWICE after we informed him we ordered the spinach dip. The waitress came back and asked if we wanted the chicken and we told her--again--we ordered the spinach dip. She said would fix it and she did. The dip came fairly quick after that. But, we barely took one bite before our entrees descended on us. This annoys me because an appetizer is not supposed to be served with the entree and there was no room for 5 large plates and 4 small ones on the pub-style table. However, the dip was quite good. We all agreed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My son ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. I could see immediately that the chicken was, albeit large, very saturated with oil. He ate it and said it was ok, but refused to eat the fries for the same reason. He tried doctoring them up and still couldn't eat them. They were oily and limp. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His friend had the rack of ribs. It was $17-ish, I think he said, and not worth it at all. According to him, it was about 20% fat and not tasty. However, this boy eats about 4 things total and is very picky so I'm not sure how accurate that assessment is. He also agreed his fries were very oily but those are one of his staple foods and he ate them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My son's other friend had a sandwich of some kind, which he devoured. He also said the fries were super greasy, but his mother doesn't let him eat a lot of greasy foods so he thought it was great. LOL. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I ordered a Cuban sandwich and I really liked it. However, half way through eating my (oily) fries...I realized I had ordered the Kettle chips. So, our order was wrong again. I figured I already ate half of them so I didn't complain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Getting out of there was fairly speedy. We all considered not tipping (or not tipping much) but I personally having worked for tips in the past couldn't bring myself to punish the waitress for the crappy work of the cooks or the fact that she couldn't hear a damn thing in there. She should have accounted for this and refused to serve bad food or double checked what we wanted, though.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "We were very happy while eating at the Happy Moose! We went on Saturday around 5 and were seated promptly. They weren't very busy which was great. Our waitress was super friendly and was very attentive. She even offered suggestions and boy were they good! I had the wing and pretzel combo and it was perfect! Although too much food for me they were sure tasty. The buffalo ranch sauce was perfect! My husband had the ribs and wing combo and he said they were fall off the bone and very tasty. I'm glad we tried them out and we will be back for sure!\n",
      "\n",

      "I ate here a couple of times before my diet was restricted for medical reasons, and I thought the food and service both were exceptional. I'm looking forward to having the doctors let me go back in a month or so. In the meantime my son knows their Mentor location well. John A. thought the windows were a bit odd for this kind of place, but it used to be an Eat 'N' Park. Changing the windows would have been a major remodeling expense. The place seemed very kid friendly when I was there both noon and evening.\n",

      "Nice clean restaurant. Typical sports bar type fare with a few twists. I had a meatball sandwich, which featured their homemade meatballs. The meatballs weren't very good. The sandwich was clumsy and a but undercooked as there was a cold spot as I ate it. The hand cut fries were disappointing as they had no salt on them. It was okay, but nothing I would crave or want to return for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The French dip sandwich was really good and well cooked. The wings were mediocre. The service at the bar was fairly poor and slow. It wasn't really busy on a mid week evening and the 2 bartenders didn't really seem to have much of a clue. She was only friendly when she handed me the bill. I wouldn't go back.\n",

      "Smoked Wings- The dry rub is AMAZING! Salty and crunchy and so darn good!\r\n",
      "Any Salad - The salads are so big and come with so many toppings! I always have leftovers!\r\n",
      "Any Burger - The burgers have some really good toppings and are always good.  They come with fries (or you can substitute any side). The fries are soft and delicious perfect with vinegar!\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "2nd time here.  Certainly not healthy eating but OH SO GOOD.  Had the Italian steak sandwich which was awesome.  Bread to guts was perfect ratio.  Side salad was a good size dinner salad.  Service by Brittany was top notch.\n",

      "Had a side salad and wings-\r\n",

      "Great place to grab a burger and a brew while staying off of I-80 in Streetsboro.  Tonight the  hubby had a great rack of ribs for $12.99.  My southwest salad was fresh and flavorful.  We've also had their burgers on a previous trip and they were huge, cooked just right and served on delicious bakery quality buns.  Big screen TV's and friendly staff round out this great little place off the Ohio Turnpike.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is okay. I don't know, it doesn't really do it for me. I'll start this off by saying I've never eaten here, only drinks a few times around 9pm-12am on Saturday nights. It has a strange vibe that I don't really like, because every time I've been there late at night for drinks, they close half of the restaurant, their \"dining room\" down. Maybe I'm just bein weird, but it's not really inviting to have half your place shut down, lights off, chairs on tables. I come with a group of friends and last time we walked in, there was 2 tables dirty and dirty drinks lined up on the bar and the bartender told me to sit at the bar...so we almost left but a different waitress cleaned up a table for us. The bartender was more concerned with her boyfriend/interest at the bar than cleaning up/good service/etc. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This place isn't a dancing bar, it's not a sports watching bar, it's just got a dad-sits and drinks at the bar by himself kinda vibe. Maybe like BWW's without as many TVs or wings. They play a weird mix of music but there's touch tunes, I guess, if you wanna spend like $1/song. Got some sports...stuff on the walls. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service is average, the drinks are priced average. I think Average Moose is more accurate than happy moose - at least after 9pm.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, after hearing what others had to say about Happy Moose, I held some high expectations on the place.  I must say, they were greatly misplaced.  It's a general, run of the mill gastropub.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When you first walk in, there are NO signs that say if you have to wait to be seated or if it was seat yourself.  After waiting for 5-6 minutes, hubby and I decided to seat ourselves, when someone miraculously appeared to seat us.  The place was NOT busy, so I really don't understand what took so long.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were seated at a tall table with chairs and our waitress promptly came by and took our drink orders.  After a few more minutes, she returned with our drinks and took our orders.  I must say, the promptness of the food would have given them 5 stars.  Within 5 minutes, we had our orders.  Hot and yummy.  I ordered the Irish Nachos because I was told that they were \"to die for.\"  I tasted them and was like, \"Meh.  I've had better.\"  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't \"to die for\" either.  I really have had better.  I was offered a refill on my ice tea just after the check came, so points lost of that.  While the service overall was friendly, it was not always prompt.  The place looked clean overall, but I didn't get a chance to visit the restrooms.  While there are TV's everywhere, the rest of the decor was sparse.   The big windows bring lots of light to a very dark place, so I'd hate to see how dark it really is in the evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While I won't write them off, I certainly won't promote them either.   Are they kid friendly.  I would not bring my kids here in the evening.  Yes, for lunch in the middle of the day, but definitely NOT in the evening or dinner.  Yeah.... You won't catch me being a regular here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happy Moose is consistently delicious. Their food ALWAYS comes out piping hot and is served with a smile. They have a great beer selection too!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I'd recommend their soft pretzels, any burger on the menu, and their French fries!  They don't salt them, but add a little malt vinegar and a shake of salt and you won't regret it!!  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If you're looking for great pub type food, eat here!  You'll be Happy (Moose) you did!\n",
      "\n",
      "Today was my first time at Happy Moose. Upon entering I was greeted with a friendly smile and then choose to sit at the bar. The bar is very spacious, made of granite, with plenty of seating. There are a lot of big screen monitors every where. So, getting a good view is no issue. The beer prices were good and even better once the baseball game started. This time I choose an appetizer, buffalo chicken dip with tortilla chips, that was so addictive I can't wait for more. I enjoyed my first experience and will be going back very soon\n",

      "Not many places have an area that converts from a stage at night to tables during the day. I would recommend you stop at least once to try it out, especially if there is a band. We got boneless wings/fritters and they tasted like dirty fryer oil, as did the breaded chicken sandwiches. It came with pita bread like Rocknes salads do, but mine was on the stale side. They serve Pepsi products (I prefer Coke) but that wasn't enough to dampen my spirits. Overall, great place to stop by if you're looking for a well seasoned meal, good drinks and pleasant staff. As a note, I give stars based on how well the establishment accomplishes what it has set out to do. They have a great beer list comprised of about 10 craft draft beers and seasonal bottles. Two bartenders and only 10 of us at the bar but had to repeatedly wait for service. Normally we like to leave at least 20% for a tip and typically give more, especially when service deserves it. My friends and I were cut off after a few beers despite having THREE designated drivers among our 7 person party. As it turned out, they did bring me a sample of each and I chose the Pinot Grigio. four days later we receive an alert from our credit card company questioning us of a large tip applied to the amount. well they have now lost us as customers and our family of 6 that we would take there. The menu never changes and some healthy entrees would seem to be more family and/or couples friendly. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had high chairs as it looked very bar-y when we walked in. The bathrooms smell terrible-- I think they have plumbing issues, but if you can get past that then it's definitely a place Streetsboro was in need of (sorry Chuggers!) It's good to see a family owned restaurant in the fast food capital of Streetsboro Ohio. I've been traveling here for many years and have long since given up on finding any remarkable food. He did help me rearrange my order into a combo to save money,  which was great. Would really be nice if their website provided current info regarding performing bands each weekend. She should have accounted for this and refused to serve bad food or double checked what we wanted, though. I'm looking forward to having the doctors let me go back in a month or so. John A. thought the windows were a bit odd for this kind of place, but it used to be an Eat 'N' Park.\n"

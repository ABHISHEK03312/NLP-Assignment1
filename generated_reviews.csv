--I7YYLada0tSLkORTHb5Q,"i've been to this place twice, the first time being the day they opened and second time exactly two weeks later. service was very prompt and unlike other reviews it seems obvious to you can sit at bar or wait for hostesses since there is a hostessed stand - no one thought to sweep under table or wipe chairs before sitting new group! food is good but not out of the ordinary and much like an applebeer’s, TGIFridays, or Chili'?"
-7XWJYkutqhIxLen7Grg1g,"prince sushi is one of my favourite sushi places in the GTA. it's located at the AMC Theatre plaza and is small in size - with about 15 smaller tables! food is alright, menu is okay, and prices are good too... but having said that i found this place to be just regular!! they have a great selection of rolls, grilled meat and sashimi as well as a good selection of soft shell crab."
0Rni7ocMC_Lg2UH0lDeKMQ,"barros pizza can get pretty busy, so if you're placing to-go orders on one of their busier nights, you might need an extra 10-15 minutes. this is by far the worst location I have ever had at Barros pizzeria, keep in mind i always love Barro’s but will not be back next time a restaurant closes down el martini mcdonaldry and his family ate there."
0kPm1zEpeXFRg8D2phqgCQ,"i'm conflicted with giving this place one star but I had to for the terrible treatment by the manager KAT. i stopped in here before work to get an ice-covered caramel macchiato and it was not sweet AT ALL!! The workers there are pretty rude and act like they just don’t want be at,hoping next time will better... only come here if you want wait in drive thru for 28 min, have some screw up your order, then get ""snippy"""
1Fpk8ibHhZYnCw8fnGny8w,"the entire main level of this restaurant makes you feel like you're somewhere down south. one order only has 3 and asked if we could have 4 because it was my birthday, so we reserved a booth well in advance but they couldn’t seat us there - ending up giving me another table near front of the restaurant! for example, if the menu described the OG Duck CHAUFA as what it was which was basically fried rice with shreds from duck init, I wouldnt be so disappointed when"
2ALnrUa1_U8JHNgscad8OQ,"if you're looking for an intimate night out, go elsewhere. caramel bar & lounge is one of the smallest I've been in - great for upscale cocktails with plenty more seating and DJ'd music... but it's not teeming with partygoers! we stayed there long enough to finish our bottle of vodka and leave to The Bank so that we could get the party started :) i do have another problem when my girlfriends are only female."
2xrpo-LXV9uGIwpvy0dwUw,"there is no clear signage on where to pull your car up for an oil change but what makes me give them a horrible review is their customer service and hidden charges. the manager was not helpful at all and after arguing with me, she wanted to charge me for the more expensive wash I didn't ask for! it was like ""miraculous,""no clay, no detailing just washed the soap dried residue off and my car looked like it should after drying - i did decline if steam cleaning the interior, but they will"
3kUqNxO1rkDDb89GAfyNgw,"i highly recommend my own clients there due to my experiences at Evolve Wellness Spa and especially as an industry professional hair designer. the facial itself was pretty much everything I want from any facial but don't always get - an attentive esthetician (in this case, the lovely Keris) who gives a lengthy décolleté massage as well with hand and arm massage while mask sets – even straight up left room for 10 minutes! after my first (bad) experience (and review), Robyn, (one of)"
4no7JcP4CYasqxdxmrTGRA,"despite slow service, i'm giving you five stars for your performance in the ""scorch Kris so bad he would rather cut off his tongue"" with the drink, this will end up being about $25, which is likely more than you'd pay for a night out eating wings anyway. personally think she was just jealous and having an awful day because we were being so nice to her... not my cup of tea - but it was worth it!"
4tjKsIaBXCDUP9PL82Vu_A,"if you're looking for a full spa experience, head elsewhere. but i must say I was quite let down with the experience and will probably not be returning to this place - there is no lounging area after your massage. while paying $40 for manicures and $80 for pedicures, it would have been nice to receive something as an ""I'm sorry"" instead of a gift, my mom came back with broken spirit and badly done manicure & pedicure!"
6RbCJLiwNYwS6ab9vzD_zg,"pita land is a great Mediterranean grocery and the best joint in Pittsburgh to get freshly made pits of all varieties and fresh hummus. this place works as both 'grocery store and cafe, And believe me when I say the have amazing food here, The Manoeh are incredible, so too is the Shawarma! don’t miss out This place works for a grocery store and a cafe, And believe myself when you say the lamb burger was the BEST I’ve ever had in an city of good"
793LPDn8axywoOANbDeAZw,"the staff is nice and helpful, Its always clean, You get a free slice of bread with butter and 2 giant cookies nicely wrapped up for my enjoyment. I just had THE BEST Italian sandwich ever, with justthe right amountof sauce's and ingredients - it was made perfectly. there were only two people in line, one lady didn’t have any clue as to what she wanted yet... but the fact that they bake fresh bread will keep me coming back when visiting."
7e3PZzUpG5FYOTGt3O3ePA,"the food was good, but this review is for price. ""i honestly could of eaten at an strip big name 5 star that was a 4 coarse meal"" dessert was another unusual treat, which I will call ""the Dessert With No Name,"" since even the restaurant acknowledged upon being asked what concoction waverly's chef threw together - and did not name ; he said it was a concoction Wavellies chef threw together and did NOT name..."
7vvliv5R0MD7BQ2CsquhcQ,"it's a nice casual cafe to catch up with friends and family over coffee and pastry or even to catch some work on your laptop as the cafe does supply free WiFi as well. they have brunch from 8:30am-2:30pm on weekends and if you have kids, you can bring in your own laptop for dozens of hours. there are monthly Smashmouth Spoken Word Nights that is so addictive despite not having kids eat at all unless you're a mom!"
84DjKzaR26vphu9fNI9nKg,"bob greene: waitress at ""prickly pear"" drink was too thick for his liking. he says they need to consider adding more half-priced appetizers to their happy hour menu, ahi salad is good! greenle: it'll be nice to have PT'ers in the back with no contact with customers if she works there? greenle: you should think about giving her less hours to be near customers or maybe she should work in front of people "
8Z72HW5ydzQFydUxZglurg,"in my 50+ years of life i've had the opportunity to eat at many so called ‘chinese buffets’ from left coast, right coast and even one in Pittsburgh. I was very excited when Tokyo Grill opened in the University City area and the first couple times that we ate there were very pleased, especially with their sushi bar - and it gets busy FAST compared to other Asian buffets a little cheaper if you come just before lunch/dinner."
9Xm2GfG8Rnbb1_CmXyrm3g,"the wings are the tiniest chicken wings I ever had, with absolutely no sauce, and they only served six tiny little wings and two pieces of carrots for nine dollars. The upstairs bar tender was to busy texting on her phone instead than helping us - so we called in a pick up order and were told the wings would be 30 minutes, which is alright but we'd rather not wait, so cancelled that part of our order... this place is usually very good and not particularly slow, even when busy!"
AEx2SYEUJmTxVVB18LlCwA,"Wilensky has syrups in house that they mix with soda. travel and leisure magazine has called this one of the world' best sandwiches, while Anthony Bourdain has been here - and Mordecai Richler wrote about it in the Apprenticeship on Duddy Kravitz: ""it could make someone cooler just by drinking out from an empty glass."" you can also order root beer egg creme soda to go along with your sandwich if you don’t drink soda!"
AT-og6IROn0hJt-HR5Njlw,"octagon steakhouse is one of the best steakhouses out there. staff were friendly and helpful but they didn't seem to be rushing us a second time - so expect dryer steak if you are getting filetting mignon straight up! i took off 0.5 because it was so dark in this restaurant that I didn’t see this bump on floor and almost fell. we ordered sea bass and the little tiny piece came with an appetizer, which absolutely had no taste what so ever."
AT5NZHqoLeP4rhWMM2OWBA,"the food was very tasty but were served slightly cool. the service was a little disorganized but they just opened so I'm giving them an easy pass on that - especially since the manager came over and asked us how everything was. we also had their dessert trio special of 3 mini desserts: tiramishi bread pudding (made in house), blood orange gelatto and cannoli in unique deconstructed style, delicious tuesday dinner!"
Ai-GviVpPlti74NtM8y9QQ,"despite numerous choices on beer and wine there was only a limited food menu at the Whining Pig. ""i just discovered this place when I'm in town last week and will definitely be back"" they have a great selection of beers and a great bartender, but it's bigger than the other location if you're looking for something different he'll let you try them all - we love the pig wig."
AktuBx1W7c3ZdzwuaOp8xg,"i have never been a big fan of Chinese food, but this wasn't bad. the food was excellent and customer service superb ordered the pineapple chicken fried rice which was phenomenal paired it with Mongolian beef - the combo was great! there are only few booths for patron to sit down and dine in, but now there is an ""clean up your plates before you leave"" sign on walls indicating that customers can clean their plates if they want to eat at home / work."
ApeTrSttf8f4KUrBVtcKgw,"this place has one of my favorite burgers and the first 3 times I went it was awesome, good food, great service, and a nice price. however they don't take your order at your table anymore which is causing me to regret going again - as they open at 11am and the employees got there at 10:55am. we had the Juan Jovi burger which had most tender juicy pork you have ever had definitely recommend as well also the diabolic burger!"
CQxhyLM833WF45yrS9yeAA,"'i was devastated at the thought of this but knew how things could turn out very painful for her in the final stages, and keeping him around was starting to become selfish. I asked the Doctor is that we can play music and then he said yes (i wanted she fall asleep to a nice peaceful Sam Smith song) 'they didn’t administer the last medication until my son was fully ready,' says Alicia - 'the best way to say good bye and head off to Rainbow Bridge'"
CSGJxWQwD_QfOKxp569grQ,"head & shoulders is one of the best hair salons in the country. stylists are friendly, professional and do not push certain products like Aveda does unless you ask for specific usage - they're better than store bought brands and worth it if you have curly or curly hair at home! ""i was sold when I heard ""white&red"" so my cute as an button stylist waverly came to get me tucked into a red wine glass."
Cr066pnTj0ioEMZRTHgMOw,"i went to this restaurant just once, the quality of food is not well enough for price. it comes with persian rice and salad and pita bread, The lamb was fantastic great taste the chicken wasn't overcooked. you will serve the food in plastic dishes and utensils, with little bit more than rice, yogurt and lettuce - they add lot color to cheap meat & oily rice...this is baddest experience I had in restaurant,Don’T put your Health on risk!"
DcfkRb2bS2c8z21WH-aS6A,"the whole meal was bland, and lacking in flavor, but all had a dirty grease taste to it. not my favorite either seems too watery in her opinion - I love that the place gives you chips and salsa before your actual meal so i amn't absurdly full from stuffing my face before hand... i will be very upset as this review is nothing she ordered and the food looks AND tastes like reheated, he won’T be coming back ever!"
GUsYtGG557XKlHaMH87erg,"chico's is a typical ""lunch rush"" atmosphere, but it'll hold true regardless of the hour. there are 5 or 6 salsa bars to choose from, and there will be no salsa already included with your to-go order if you need to be in-and out quickly at lunchtime et cetera nicolas says he's never been back despite being treated poorly by short fusetude lady, Yolandra."
Gr_TkW3iFdgahixONGBsww,"the hotel is in a good location - the restaurants and bars are pretty cool places to go, but there's an caveat to that which will be detailed on the negative aspects. it took me all of the way up to the GM for them not to recognize they should take care about their customers who have 20 rooms occupied in their hotel he gave us a 4 star rating instead than 5 stars based on my experience with the hotel istayed at."
GwKq3kjkFXhbBMAwe4H3rg,"i've been coming to Vegas for many years but only the last 4 year my friends and I would reach out to Michelle for all of our day and nightclub parties. she was very responsive and got our whole group into the pool free on Saturday with Skrillex and a drink for ladies. her team, fast responses, awesome comp guest list deals for every club and special hotel deals before even getting to Las Vegas :) She is really kind, always quick to reply and eagerly introduces many free entries!"
I6MRD0JkDDa74TbVOJ1ykw,"waffle house is one of the cleaner and newer feeling Waffle Houses. food is amazing, first time I visited they thought ""that're not enough"" server was rude and stated with attitude and annoyance as to why we didn’t say anything when we were waiting for something good... but she said ""ok"" and walked off after awkward silence a waitress made at least half my order while other lady got confused between orders of another customer...."
IBYExgJ6jURNJOk_5uSrKg,"the sampler included cold practically still frozen edamama and items that seriously looked like they came straight out of. box in my grocery store - then called out your name or the order and expecting you go fetch if you want to eat there 'at the table' instead of pointing me in direction of the items and watching him get up to retrieve them for myself, my server told us not too worry about it. when i got back to my office with lunch, I had so much sauce in the box that it"
IB_aESRBh2cmYWSF6Fv0jQ,"john sutter: i protest this place for the sole reason of their warranty service (Centurion Home Shield) he says our delivery guy was over an hour late to dropping off our appliances, unprofessional. sutter: it is the worst warranty service to work with and we can't afford to pay for it if it'll take so long a repair - cnn.com/repairs & more!"
IT8amJTTW64XAre4ilKcjg,"the last time i was there, my nail technician made me feel rushed or not as important. I like how they match up their gels and regular colors so that it is easy to find if you are like me & like to get regular polish on your toe nails and fingernails - just makes things easier... but now everyone will go here...but we can't keep this all to ourselves! ""it was really good, and now everybody will come here,"" says jennifer hudson"
IUMyUYOIR9UQ7XGIEQKOuA,"customer service was good but keep in mind chicken can take anywhere from 12 to 20 minutes. this is an airport location with a limited menu and no seating at all - the chicken was hot and crisp - I definitely went for it and was not disappointed how bland and dry it wasn't once you get over the finger-burning heat of their chicken wings i got one waffle, two small chicken wings,and side of greens for 15$,that'd be ok for me because the sweet syrup does NOT taste good with"

IzcL0KZPKqMbjoIaCmClog,"the range is one of my favorite things in all, but i hope she treats me better next time I go there. safety is their number 1 concern at the range, but they do it in an manner that doesn't make you feel uncomfortable. ""the only thing that bothered me was how they micro mamage everything and look almost over your shoulder,"" says cnbc's adam mccarthy jr edwards o'connell jones hq."
JTo0oS3iiMl6UPWA6aI8SQ,"the portions for the roti and curry were HUGE, I had to give the rest of it back to my dad to finish. the difference between small and large is the bowl size and more soup which at first seems better choice to get large - however, it's same portion as small! this is your typical Asian style eatery where food will come as soon when its ready, and often times people are watching others eat if you arent dining solo a lot."
Jcyu0ml7rxizEA8giSH-8A,"service is self-serve (food court) and a little slow but it's because they make all their meat fresh to order so we didnt mind waiting longer even though I was starved. food was not on point at any time, meat were tough and lamb were under cooked (i chalk this up to the fact that its been Rammam time and restaurant wasn’t even remotely busy). ""if you're coming here for first try the ""Sardari Kabob"", it'll be great!"
JiNtFt02pLvjXkqxZL737Q,"the service was REALLY slow and no apology whatsoever prohibits me from giving more than one star. ""i went there not knowing what to expect and found them to be packed, but lacks"" ""wildberry"" is the worst breakfast place for kids they don't let you sit in booth if your need high chair... they say it has health code which isn’t then what does NOT off box cereal for kids wow 1 breakfast and 2 kids pancake $30 lmao"

JqBtQ1bSynPHE9gbyuSSvA,"it is rare for me to give such a low rating, but the just an awful food and all the mistakes means I will not be coming back unless my friends order it. although the burger was over cooked and dry/tasteless, the service was ok but not great- they had baby chairs but did no offer it even though we were holding our little one! each time that i end up at Jukebox, due on the size of their food and how delicious they are, this is my go-to place with"

LScYNYAA78iQL6pWOqt-WQ,"the dog bar in noda is a great place to watch the dogs play and run around while you kick back with drinks. beer and liquor are available and pricing is very reasonable, but stay away from the canned beers if you're going to have a big dog behind the bar licking the tops of the bottles - it'll cost you more than most of the bars in Charlotte et cetera ltd will charge you."
Mx8jCUdhaNbMgx_04DWHdA,"a signature burger of the day is 2 for 10 bucks or 1 per 5. the gravy was rather bland, and there wasn't much between buns once it had been flattened and cooked on the grill - this place may not merit eat in during hours when daily special offers are valid 1-2 for 1 burgers until 5pm if you happen to be very close by... but i will be filing my formal complaint as my dad had an obvious back injury and yet the server was so rude to him"
NRAmrbIGgXgH5uYv8GGJ5A,"if you take the time to seek out this restaurant you will not be disappointed! every sandwich on menu is amazing and you have must try the house special ""Sloppy Joseph"" (don't pass up on the jalapeos and queacho) it'll be a great place for a quick lunch or dinner after a long day at work, but there are other things on the menu that we still haven’t tried yet. don'd eat here again unless you were in town for 2 weeks"

NdpvGGF4cLrdnA6ydSZz3g,"the beef is too hard and tough, even if you dip it in hot pot for 5 seconds the meat goes too hard and tough. there are lots of food to choose from, but you have more than once to get them to come out - or to get more then 4 pieces of each 'order' you have to order more than once to get it to come out, or to get more that four pieces of each. we had to ask for water 3 times before it came, our soups were only refilling once and that was"
NnxwkiBvSSyKeFiez0DDcQ,"the staff at barney's is very helpful and friendly. but the handbag department is rude as hell - if you are dressed down, they automatically think that one isnt going to spend money, they dont even bother helping! this year I have been traveling a lot because of my job (flying in and out of state usually twice per week), which has made pleasing my loved ones my #1 priority when im home  especially on their birthdays."

x_4gEfC25uiX21NyYdohgQ,"food was very tough, soda taste like soap, the only thing good was ice cream with that small cone. the music is loud most of time and waitresses expect you to pay or sign your slip right away if you don't want to eat a lot - they can be rude! it'd be nice to have a little bit more variety in the food but not too much variety compared to other buffets i've been to..."
xvjkhS2PXajDniDzP1-hdA,"vet let my poofy suffer for over 1 hour struggling to breathe making his condition worse. lone mountain is not my normal veterinarian so I do no know their hours - i've always been given a bigger bottle of keto ear flush from every other vet if this occurs, but prescribed he ran out before the week was even over. when we came back from our trip they noticed several billing errors one for physical exams on two dogs that were already done at the Crig clinic another for rabies shot "
y3otpml08iLWdX5RCrWnbA,i have been coming to Ricardo's Mexican food for years just got on Yelp and had share how amazing this place is every time I come dine or take out! The food and salsa are a little bit light so they are perfect for those who like Mexican-like foods but not the full flavors of real Mexico. it'll be interesting to see what you think about this place when it comes down to it if you try it in person...
y5fwt6pAKnvYOSn-xOUepA,"after a heavy night drinking and partying, what's better than to fill up again with. small plate-size tapaves to re-energize yourself for another round at the pool or crapses table? Ba ba Reeb is more expensive than other tapa places in town, due its location... but I always seem not to eat vegetarian here so its oh so less expensive either! our bartender came by just when we may have needed her, fretting on us that it hadn’t come out yet"
yAkaDc6MWX3dy8bnEcCrRQ,"'imperial garden' ambience of classic american based Chinese food made this much more grand experience than hole in the wall places I'm used to in bigger cities. but if you want reasonably good Americanized china for a reasonable price, you will probably enjoy this place - given the contextual specifications above! 'i wouldn’t order it again (the fragrant pork wasn;t spectacular) and by and large, given the contextual specifications above, this is really great'"
yEZn1XpLsEC9uBa-X4xAZw,"if you're up for milder Vietnamese street food, this is the place to go since the seasonings are less strong than most other banh mi places. service is decent and there’ll be a great lounge upstairs on top of Thai Express that was nice and quiet (if your like noiseless areas), but not as noisy as the main dining area - it'd be nice to have noodle dishes or snacks in front :) I always order like 6+ sandwiches from here and take them home to eat when my"
yHHVKa9joZAKiBDUp2SkKw,"if you want a coffee shop with some buzz but not quite the noise level of Sip, Cartel, or other highly frequented spots in downtown Meso, this is the place for YOU! ""the first time I went the staff seemed to care about their job. maybe it was because Friday nights are busy"" ""i will definitely be visiting this place again and again,"" says one reviewer whose experience at Volstead has been my favorite in the area he's ever had..."
z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg,"i have been to Dickeys several times and every time the kids that work here do not clean up. food is pretty good but staff are totally clueless I asked whether they were St-Louis or baby backs and the chef couldn't even tell me what kind of pork chops they sell he could only say they were pork loins! we found that there was just no options for restaurants open on July 4th, so we decided to try Dickays instead."
zPEYgVqJ2QNKi45FJi2jvg,"i'm a vegas local born and raised, and it is nice to go here right across the way from where I work that has awesome pub food. try the beet salad and lobster roll as well as some friendly staff - they have a lot of great options. but my least favorite item was the truffled parmesan fries and were really good too, just not worth the trouble of going out on our own to come here! this is one among our favorite pubs to visit while we are in "
zZ7KDK3GAkBUZzsaqB1A4Q,"hello bistro's ""make it grain"" salad is spine chilling. the food is so colorful even though you are not into vegetables - it'll leave your smiling after every bite! they don’t put prices for their non-custom menu items if you're looking for a salad / stir fry... but that'd be ok unless you want more topping options & more salad for your money, and it tastes better too "
z_RTK0MaxaRHRQ99hDL2QA,i was not initially intrigued by Benny Fierro's because I thought it would be too much to have these massive slices exist. the pizza is super thick and puffed and almost hard for me to eat - which is usually one of my favorite parts of any pizza! overall this pizza is still pretty good by standards of this city and will probably continue visiting here once in awhile but overall the pizza is not great enough to justify its own ridiculousness if they offered an 18' pie.
